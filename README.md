# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Attention-based-Transformers.
The assigned project, Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Attention-based Transformers, requires students to implement and fine-tune a sequence-to-sequence Transformer model (or a time-series specific variant like Informer or Autoformer) for multi-step multivariate time series forecasting.
